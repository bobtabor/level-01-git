# Git Level 1 - First steps with Git

This is the content repo for the video course **level-01-git** on [https://bobtabor.com](https://bobtabor.com).  The **Code** tab contains all of the scripts that I used for this course, as well as a place to view the **Wiki** tab containing frequently asked questions, and you can ask questions specific to this course on the **Issues** tab.

This course is a "Level 1" course, meaning that it is here to help prepare you for Level 2 courses.
