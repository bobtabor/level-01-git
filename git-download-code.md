In this course, you'll learn just enough Git to download my source code files from Github to your local computer.  You'll learn how to navigate to different branches so you can view different states of my code files, and you'll learn what to do in case you make a change to my code and git asks you to commit your changes before you can continue.


================================================================

Learning Objective: The learner will clone Git repos from Github and change branches so that they can view Bob's source code and complete exercises and challenges.

Pre-requisites:
- Git installed
- Basic command prompt commands like: dir, cd, mkdir

Before we jump in, I just want to set your expectations and encourage you to resist the temptation to take shortcuts.

Git is a command line tool, and it uses a series of commands, switches and flags to execute its functionality.  There are so many commands, switches and flags that it can seem complex.  You might be tempted to just learn how to use one of many user interfaces that have been built on top of Git to mask the complexity.  However, I think that would be a mistake to start off that way.  If you force yourself to work through the complexity, you'll be able to understand what it is doing and why.  After you learn how Git works, understand the basic workflow, and understand a few basic commands, you can decide whether a graphical user interface could help accelerate your workflow.  But using the command line at first is crucial to helping you build a mental model of what is happening and why.
